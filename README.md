## The Banking Triangle 

This project analyzes the performance of the Saudi banking sector by examining the dynamic relationship between central bank monetary policies and market outcomes. Within the broader framework of Saudi Vision 2030, the financial sector serves as a critical driver of economic transformation and housing market expansion.

The analysis is structured around a strategic analytical triangle: **monetary policy** (interest rates – SAIBOR), **consumer credit behavior** (mortgage financing), and **institutional profitability** (net banking performance). 

The central question addressed by this dashboard is: 
> "To what extent do fluctuations in interest rates (SAIBOR) influence mortgage financing volumes and the overall profitability of Saudi banks?"

By answering this question, the dashboard provides stakeholders with a clear, data-driven visualization of how macroeconomic decisions cascade through the financial system — impacting both individual borrowers and major banking institutions.

## Data Source
 The analytical foundation of this project is built on officially published data sourced from the Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) Open Data Portal. This source was selected to ensure institutional reliability and reflect the most accurate macro-financial indicators within the Kingdom.
 To complement the macroeconomic data, financial statements and banking performance reports were also obtained from the Saudi Exchange (Tadawul). This source was used to collect quarterly financial data of listed Saudi banks, including net profits, total assets, and dividend distributions, allowing for a deeper analysis of institutional profitability trends.

 The dataset spans from 2021 to 2025 and includes a combination of time-series and categorical financial data, structured into three main components:

1. **Monetary Indicators:** The 3‑month SAIBOR (Saudi Interbank Offered Rate), serving as the benchmark for lending rates.
2. **Lending Dynamics:** Detailed data on new residential mortgage financing (categorized into Villas, Apartments, and Land) alongside consumer lending activity.
3. **Banking Performance:** Key financial indicators including Total Assets, Total Deposits, and Quarterly Net Profits across the Saudi banking sector.

Together, these sources enable an integrated analysis of how monetary policy shifts are associated with mortgage financing trends and overall banking sector performance.
