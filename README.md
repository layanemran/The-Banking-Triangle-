## The Banking Triangle 

This project analyzes the performance of the Saudi banking sector by examining the dynamic relationship between central bank monetary policies and market outcomes. Within the broader framework of Saudi Vision 2030, the financial sector serves as a critical driver of economic transformation and housing market expansion.

The analysis is structured around a strategic analytical triangle: **monetary policy** (interest rates – SAIBOR), **consumer credit behavior** (mortgage financing), and **institutional profitability** (net banking performance). 

The central question addressed by this dashboard is: 
> "To what extent do fluctuations in interest rates (SAIBOR) influence mortgage financing volumes and the overall profitability of Saudi banks?"

By answering this question, the dashboard provides stakeholders with a clear, data-driven visualization of how macroeconomic decisions cascade through the financial system — impacting both individual borrowers and major banking institutions.
